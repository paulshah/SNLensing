# SNLensing

Pantheon_deltam_lens.csv
---
A file containing $\Delta_{\rm lens}$ for each SN Ia in the Pantheon compilation. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.09865.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10688.pdf for details on the methodology.

Notes:

1) The value is 0 if the SN Ia falls outside the SDSS foreground footprint, redshift range (0<z<1), or the host couldn't be matched
2) The values may be subtracted from Pantheon magnitudes to de-lens them
3) Pantheon magnitudes may be found at https://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon/blob/master/lcparam_full_long.txt or mirror sources
